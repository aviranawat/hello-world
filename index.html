            <mark>Example 1: The effect is really pronounced when you have a controller with a large cache (like good RAID5 controller) where ~500mb of data can be cached quickly before it must be flushed to the disk.

            Example 2: You can see the cache at play if you pull the flash drive out at the same time the file copy "finished". At this point in time your file is split between the disk and the cache - so the copy is "finished" as far as the operating system is concerned but the disk controller still needs to write what's left in the cache to the disk. If you put the flash drive back in and inspect the file you'll see it's not all there.

            Disclaimer: </mark>These examples won't work if you don't have write caching enabled in your operating system/on the disk.

            Further, if it's not disk caching at work then it's likely that what you're seeing is an effect of fragmentation. As the disk gets fuller and fuller less contiguous free space is available and the file system has to work harder to find places to put your files.</p>
